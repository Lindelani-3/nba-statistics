# Dimensionality Reduction and Analysis of NBA Player Statistics

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook and associated data for my project on analyzing NBA player statistics.

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore complex NBA player performance data using advanced dimensionality reduction techniques including t-SNE, MDS (Multidimensional Scaling), and UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection). The goal is to extract and visualize meaningful insights from the data while comparing the effectiveness of these techniques.

### Key Objectives
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implementing robust data cleaning and preparation methods.
- **Advanced Dimensionality Reduction**: Utilizing t-SNE, MDS, and UMAP for in-depth data analysis.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Evaluating the results of each technique to understand their specific strengths and applications in sports data.
- **Visualization**: Creating clear and informative visualizations to represent the findings.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation
- SKLearn and UMAP for dimensionality reduction
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

## Datasets

The datasets include `nba_2022-23_all_stats_with_salary.csv`, `nba_salaries_clean.csv`, and `nba_stats_clean.csv`, providing extensive details on player performances and salaries.
